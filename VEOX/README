	The program 'MASEstp' is the client side of a seismogram
transfer system of the Tectonics Observatory.  The defualt settings
in the program will connect to the Tectonics Observatory server.
This program has similar but more limited functionality compared with
the 'stp' interface of the Southern California Earthquake Data Center.

	To create the client program on your machine, execute
		make MASEstp       (on UNIX-solaris computers)
		make linux_MASEstp (on Linux and Mac)S/X machines)

	To get started with the program execute
		MASEstp
and at the prompt type 'help'. If you want a test run try
STP> verbose
STP> input test
STP> quit
